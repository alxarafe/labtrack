# LabTrack

## Tracking manufacturing sequences

This software enables monitoring of the manufacturing, repair and verification process in a production chain.

It is based on a development carried out for monitoring a dental prosthesis workshop, but it is applicable to any production chain that wishes to carry out comprehensive monitoring.

Monitoring is provided via a pin, so that part is semi-public and should only be used in controlled environments such as a laboratory intranet, never on the Internet.
